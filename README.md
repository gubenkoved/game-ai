# game-ai
Generic two-players games AI that includes:
* Brute force engine
* Minimax with alpha-beta pruning

The whole point is to write AI that will treat any game that follows the simple contract equaly.
This will allow to apply to just to any two player game w/o any changes! Games like tic-tac-toe, checkers or even chess are on the list.
